Here's a README file description summarizing your project with focus on real-time streaming using Kafka simulation and the free Databricks edition:

Real-Time Order Tracking Pipeline using Local File Streaming and Databricks (Kafka Simulation)
Overview
This project simulates a real-time streaming data pipeline for order tracking that mimics Kafka behavior using local files, integrated with Databricks free edition for processing and analytics.

Instead of requiring a fully-managed Kafka cluster, this method generates JSON order events as files locally and uses Databricks Structured Streaming to consume new files continuously â€” providing a cost-effective, accessible real-time analytics solution.

Key Features
Kafka-like streaming simulation: Local Python producer creates JSON order files every few seconds acting like Kafka messages.

Databricks Auto Loader: Automatically detects new files in the streaming folder and processes them in near real-time.

Open-source and free to run: Uses local resources and Databricks Community or free-tier edition, eliminating infrastructure and licensing costs.

Delta Lake integration: Supports storing streaming results in Delta tables for scalable, ACID-compliant analytics with SQL querying.

Easy to extend: Can be adapted to real Kafka streaming by replacing file source with actual Kafka topic consumption in Databricks.

Architectural Method
Local Producer Script:
A Python script runs locally to generate JSON event files with order data every few seconds in a designated folder.

File Upload to Databricks:
Files are batch-uploaded or continuously synced to Databricks DBFS /FileStore/orders_stream/ folder using Databricks UI or CLI.

Structured Streaming in Databricks:
Databricks notebook reads the streaming folder with Spark readStream().json() API and processes data with timestamp-based aggregation, filtering, and transformation in real time.

Output & Persistence:
Streaming results are displayed in notebook console and optionally persisted to Delta tables for further SQL analytics and dashboarding.

Benefits
Cost efficient: No Kafka cluster cost, uses free Databricks Community Edition features.

Simple Setup: Lightweight Python scripts, no complex distributed system management.

Real-time analytics: Near-real-time aggregation and monitoring of order events.

Future proof: Easily interoperable with production Kafka setups, enabling migration to bigger pipelines.

Usage Notes
Requires Python installed locally for running the order generator.

Requires Databricks Workspace for streaming processing and storage.

Continuous data flow requires syncing local files to DBFS periodically (via CLI or scripts).

Ensure proper checkpoint and output directory settings in Databricks streaming code for fault tolerance.
